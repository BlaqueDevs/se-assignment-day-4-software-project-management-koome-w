## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile is best suited for projects where requirements are expected to change and where frequent feedback and adaptability are crucial. It fosters collaboration and continuous improvement but requires active involvement and can be less predictable in terms of cost and timeline. While Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined, stable requirements and where a structured, predictable approach is needed. It provides clear documentation and milestones but lacks flexibility and can be risky if requirements change.

Agile Methodology
Advantages:
Flexibility: Agile allows for changes in requirements even late in the development process.
Customer Satisfaction: Regular deliveries of working software ensure continuous feedback and alignment with customer needs.
Risk Management: Early and frequent testing helps identify and address issues promptly.
Team Morale: Encourages team collaboration and empowerment, leading to higher motivation and productivity.
Transparency: Regular meetings (e.g., daily stand-ups, sprint reviews) keep everyone informed about progress and challenges.

Disadvantages:
Requires Commitment: Needs active involvement from stakeholders and team members, which can be resource-intensive.
Less Predictable: Flexible scope can make it difficult to predict the final cost and timeline.
Documentation: Less emphasis on documentation can lead to knowledge gaps if team members leave.
Complexity: Managing multiple iterations and continuous integration can be complex and require skilled practitioners.

Waterfall Methodology
Advantages:
Clear Structure: Well-defined phases and milestones make it easy to understand and manage.
Documentation: Extensive documentation ensures a clear record of requirements, design, and processes.
Predictability: Fixed scope and requirements make it easier to estimate costs and timelines.
Suitable for Stable Requirements: Ideal for projects with well-understood and unchanging requirements.

Disadvantages:
Inflexible: Difficult to accommodate changes once the project has started.
Late Testing: Testing occurs at the end, which can lead to the discovery of major issues late in the project.
Customer Feedback: Limited customer involvement until the end, which can result in misalignment with customer needs.
Risk of Obsolescence: Long development cycles can result in deliverables that are outdated by the time they are completed.
